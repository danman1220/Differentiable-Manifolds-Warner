\section{Lie Groups and Second Countability}

\emph{Problem 3}: a Lie group is a differentiable manifold which also has a
group structure such that the map $G\times G \to G$ defined by $(\sigma, \tau)
\to \sigma \tau^{-1}$ is $C^{\infty}$. Prove the assumption of second
countability in a connected Lie group is redundant.
\\

\emph{Solution}:
For this proof, we will use the result that the Lie group is the union of powers
of any neighborhood of the identity.
One can construct, then, a countable neighborhood basis for the Lie group by
taking countable powers of the neighborhood.
