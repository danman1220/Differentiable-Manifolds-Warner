\section{Wedge Product Preservatives}

\emph{Problem 4}: Show that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are closed forms, then 
$\alpha\wedge\beta$ is also closed. Furthermore, if they are exact, then their
wedge is also exact.

\emph{Solution}: I will begin by showing the preservation of closedness. if
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are closed, then $d\alpha=0$, and $d\beta=0$. Then,
\[
\begin{aligned}
d(\alpha\wedge\beta) &= (d\alpha)\wedge\beta +
                        (-1)^{\text{some power}}\alpha\wedge(d\beta)\\
                     &= 0\wedge\beta +
                        (-1)^{\text{some power}}\alpha\wedge0\\
                     &= 0
\end{aligned}
\]
So, $\alpha\wedge\beta$ is closed.
\\
Next, let's show exactness is preserved.
Suppose $\alpha=d\lambda$ and$\beta=d\mu$. Then,
\[
\begin{aligned}
\alpha\wedge\beta &= (d\lambda)\wedge(d\mu) \\
                  &= d(\lambda\wedge(d\mu))
\end{aligned}
\]
So, the wedge is exact.
