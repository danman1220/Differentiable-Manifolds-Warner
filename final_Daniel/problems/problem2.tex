\section{The Exactness of Left Wedging}

\emph{Problem 2}: Let $\xi \in V$. Prove that the composition
\[
\Lambda_p(V) \to^{\xi\wedge} \Lambda_{p+1}(V) \to^{\xi\wedge} \Lambda_{p+2}(V) 
\]
is exact.

\emph{Solution}: First, I will prove that the sequence is a cochain complex.
Then, I will prove that the sequence is exact at $p+1$.

% COCHAIN COMPLEX|
%-----------------
It is easy to see that the composition of any two sequential arrows is null. To
see this, observe that the composition looks like
\[
\xi\wedge\xi\wedge v
\]
For some $v\in \Lambda_p(V)$. But, since $\xi\wedge\xi=0$, the whole product
equals zero.

% EXACTNESS|
%-----------
Exactness of the sequence involves showing that
$\text{ker}(\xi\wedge) = \text{im}(\xi\wedge)$.
However, the kernel of this map is precisely those exterior products in
$\Lambda_{p+1}(V)$ that contain $\xi$ as one of their terms. (That is, vectors
that have a component along $\xi$) It is clear that
the image of this map is the same thing. Since the wedge product is alternating,
it is possible to move the $\xi$ along any point of the wedge product. Thus, the
image of $\xi\wedge$ is the elements of $\Lambda_{p+1}(V)$ that have $\xi$ as an
element of their product.
\\
Thus, the sequence is exact.
